With D3CM you will be able to fully customize your Diablo 3 character inventory.
Its database contains every image in the game apart from Legendary Items, which will be added further on.
Unlike many other tools, you will not be bound to your Internet connection to use it, as no connection is required to fetch any information.
Other features include the possibility to store items and item sets in the database, so that you will not need to insert the same item over and over again, and an accurate Item Comparison utility, which emphasizes the stats affected by the two items when equipped.
