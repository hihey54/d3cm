**Running the Program**


Run the program by double clicking on D3CM.exe.
Please note that the first start can be really long (up to one minute length) because the program needs to create the database of all the items. However, the Loading Bar we inserted should assure you that everything is working correctly.

After the database has been loaded, a window will appear. Here, you will be asked to choose the class of your character by clicking on the right banner. A tooltip should appear if you hover the mouse pointer over any of the images, stating which class you are selecting.
From top to bottom, classes are:
  1. Barbarian
  1. Demon Hunter
  1. Monk
  1. Witch Doctor
  1. Wizard

Now a new window should appear, showing the inventory of your naked character.
You can open more windows, if you want: you just need to click again on the class you want to customize.

On the top of the window you will see three tabs:
  1. "Character Summary", in which you will be able to equip your items/presets, look at your stats and look at how your inventory should look like in the game (remember that we did include every picture in the game apart from Legendaries!)
  1. "Item Customization", in which you will be able to insert, edit or delete an item in the database.
  1. "Items Comparison", in which you will be able to look at how your stats should be when you equip two different types of items/presets.

Anyway, from now on everything should be quite easy to understand, as we tried to make the User Interface as similar as possible to those in the full game. However, if you really need more insight, here you go...


**Character Summary**


Let us start explaining from the first tab, Character Summary.

<img src='http://i.imgur.com/XyC7otl.png' alt='' title='Hosted by imgur.com' />

At the top side of the tab, you will be able to change the gender of your character, which will result in a different Inventory Background and skin for some items.

At the left side of the window, you will see the list of all your statistics. They are catalogued in the same way as in the full game, but we did some minor tweaks to it.
Firstly, we added the "Skills" and "Extra" rows. The "Skills" row shows how some of your skills are affected by your equipment, while the "Extra" row shows the overall possibility of your procs (Blind, Immobilize, Knockback, Slow, Stun, Chill, Fear, Freeze), as well as some information against Elites.
Secondly, we changed the "Block Amount", shown in the game, to "Average Block Amount", which is the average damage absorbed by your shield each time you are hit. We found this information to be more accurate than the one shown in the game.

At the right side of the window, you will be able to equip on your character the items you stored in the database by selecting the name of the item in any of the comboboxes. You will also be able to save a Preset: simply equip any combination of items, type a name in the Text Field on the left of the "Save Preset" button and click on the same button. Now, you will be able to equip those combination of items again just by selecting the Preset name in the Preset combobox. You can also edit a Preset if you select it in the Preset Combobox, add or remove items and press the "Save Preset" button, or you can change its name too, by editing the Preset name in the text field. Lastly, you can delete a preset by clicking the "Delete Preset" button at the bottom AFTER you have selected a Preset in the Preset combobox.

At the bottom side of the window you will find the main attributes, your damage per second (DPS), the damage reduction (DR) provided by Armor and All Resistances and your Effective Health Pool (EHP), which takes into consideration your dodge chance and your Damage Reduction values.



**Item Customization**

At the top left corner of the window you can choose between a Weapon Item (off-hand items included) or an Armor Item. If you select Armor, you will be asked to select the Gender of your character, as the skin of many items (Chests mostly) depends on it.

Below the Weapon/Armor radio buttons, you will find the Load Item combobox, in which you will find all the items you have saved (remember to select the Weapon/Armor category of item before searching for a specific item!). After loading an item, you can either edit some of its parameters, rename it or simply delete it by clicking on the Delete button at the bottom of the window.

Then, from top to bottom, you will find the Name text field, in which you can type the name of your item and the Type combobox, which contains all the item types of the category you chose.
_Remember that both the Name AND Type fields MUST be filled in order to Save an item in the database!_

Then, depending on the category and type of item you chose, you will find an Attack Speed text field (replaced by an Armor text field if you are customizing a Shield). Just fill this text field with the Attack Speed value of the weapon shown in the game.
Below, you will find the Item Level slider. Use it to select the correct item level for your item. Keep in mind that the item level highly affects the skin of the item, so if you want to see how your item looks like in the game, try to input the correct value.

Below, again, depending on the category and type of item you chose, you will find some text fields. Fill them with the information provided in game.

Finally, at the end, you will find the attribute comboboxes. Just select one of the attributes and type its value on the right. Please note that, in order to insert the second attribute, you MUST have inserted the first attribute.

Here are some guidelines when inserting your attributes:
  1. The "Attack Speed Increased by %" only works on Armor and off-hand items (such as Quivers, Mojos and Orbs). DO NOT put it on a weapon. The correct attribute for a weapon is "Increases attack speed by %".
  1. The "Indestructible" attribute does not require a value.
  1. e suggest NOT to insert Class-Specific attributes (such as "Increases Damage of Bola Shot by %") if you plan on using that item on a different class, as this will most likely corrupt the item.

We are currently aware that some attributes are missing. Missing attributes will be added further on.


**Item Comparison**

This is the simplest of the three tabs. You just need to select your items/presets from the comboboxes and the different statistics will be shown in the central sheet. Higher values will be green-colored, while lower values will be red-colored.

With this tab you will easily understand the difference between two items when equipped, as it is far more accurate than the info displayed on the items in the game. IE: what does "protection" mean? And what if I am planning to change more than one item at the same time? With the Item Comparison tab, your question will be answered in one go.
